# Team 16 Design Document


Our mechanic is an inventory system for a run-and-gun platformer type of game. We want an easy to access system that can easily be opened on the spot and everything can be read at a quick glance/hover.

- Interchangable items
- Usable in a game
- Easy navigation

## Objective
The objective is to make an enjoyable and easy to navigate basic interface for a game that makes it easy to see what items you have and easy to switch to. We want to have a system that's possible for someone to immediately understand in the same way old games can be instantly recognizable.

## Experience

> We envision an experience in which the user
> Can easily use and navigate our inventory
> And recognize all items
> With no major learning curve

## Workflow/Major Changes
Inventory is finished before the items to be placed within it, it is in seemingly good working order
Got a 2d platformer template going to mesh everything within
Changed from a gun that shoots enemies to a gun that shoots platforms beneath you due to a technical error turned fun idea
The first item, a gun that builds platforms beneath you, has been finished
